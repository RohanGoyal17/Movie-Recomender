# Movie-Recomender

<b>Part 1</b>  Warm Up Problems <br><br>
Execute data.java, the code will prompt for the required inputs.

```
$ javac data.java
$ java data
```

Wrong inputs will crash the code (GIGO ;) ) <br>
Files need to be in the same directory as data.java <br>
Genres are always taken as a input in integer (index) <br>
Exception has been handled for one outlying data entry in movies.data (line :267) <br>
If in any part a query/queries are entered for which there is no movie, then the output is blank <br>
